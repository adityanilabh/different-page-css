css layout- the display property.

display property is the most important css property for controlling layout.
it decide how an element is displayed.
default display value of most element is block or inline.

inline: horizontal (link list in nav bar)
block: vertical.(same as above)
h1.hidden{
visibility:hidden;
}


MAX-WIDTH:

it is used for resizing a block as responsive and if max-width is some value, it won't increase above that value but may decreease as screen resizes. width and max-width has that above difference.
