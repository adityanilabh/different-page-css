INLINE STYLES: an inline style is attached directly to the element to be styled. example: <h1 style="color: #ffffff;">
IDs- An ID is a unique identifiers for the page element such as #navbar.
Classes, attributes and pseudo-classes.= this includes .classes, and pseudo-classes like :hover, :after and so on.

h1{ background-color: yellow;}
h1{background-color: red;}

div#a {background-color: green;}
